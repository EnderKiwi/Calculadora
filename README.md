# Calculadora

by EnderKiwi

## Description

This is a learning project for C so I can better learn the concepts and functions.

Planned to be a command line calculator, but maybe if I like it enough I'll make it have a GUI.

## Modules

As part of this project, I have two modules or subprojects that are a part of this project. These are `math` and `util`. `util` provides utility for the terminal and other things that C is somewhat lacking in like error handling. Basically just to make it a little easier.

I might make `util` into it's own separate project itself as I have used parts of it in other projects.

`math` is somewhat useless outside of this project so it is likely going to stay here.
